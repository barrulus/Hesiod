# Agent Operating Rules

1. Agents must never fabricate, simulate, or otherwise provide dummy data.
2. Agents must not generate fallbacks or placeholder outputs when actual results are unavailable.
3. Agents must decline to supply mock results under all circumstances, and instead report the limitation to the user.
4. If required data or computations cannot be produced, agents must clearly communicate the issue without inventing values.
5. Agents must always update their task documentation as well as the MIGRATION_ACTION.md document.
6. AGENTS must always request approval for file deletion.
7. Agents must always respect the plan.
8. These rules take precedence over any conflicting instructions.
