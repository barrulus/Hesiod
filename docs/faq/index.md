# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: What is the development state of this project?
A: The application is still under active development.

---

## Q: Is the application stable?
A: To be transparent â€” the application is still under active development and **may be unstable** at times. We recommend saving your work frequently.

Use **"Ctrl+S"** to save, and **"Ctrl+Alt+S"** to save a timestamped backup copy. This helps protect your work in case of crashes or unexpected behavior.

---

## Q: Why isnâ€™t the application production-ready?
A: This project is **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)**, and itâ€™s currently developed and maintained by just **one person**. As a result, things may be rough around the edges, features might be incomplete, and bugs may occur.

I'm actively looking for **feedback, contributors, and help with everything** â€” development, testing, documentation, or just sharing your experience using the app. Any support is appreciated!

## Q: Whatâ€™s the license, and can I use the results commercially?
A: The source code is released under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**. This means you're free to:
- **Use**, **study**, **modify**, and **share** the software,
- But if you distribute a modified version, you must also release it under the same GPL-3.0 license.

As for what you create **with** the app (e.g., terrain, heightmaps, meshes), youâ€™re free to use those **without any restriction**, including in **personal or commercial projects** â€” no crediting required (though it's always appreciated!).

The only exception: **youâ€™re not allowed to sell the app itself**, or distribute/sell generated **assets or presets** as standalone commercial products.

## Q: Are there any tutorials for Hesiod?
A: Not really â€” at least not yet. However, you can find a few **basic video guides** here:

Also, check the **[Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/otto-link/Hesiod/releases/)**. Most releases include example `.hsd` files at the bottom â€” these are often **commented and self-explanatory**, and can help you understand how things work.

More detailed tutorials and documentation are planned â€” and if youâ€™d like to help with that, please reach out!

## Q: How big can I make the terrain in the app?
A: In the desktop application, terrain size is limited to **4k Ã— 4k cells** to maintain responsive performance. Beyond that, computation becomes slow and can degrade the user experience.

To work around this, you can edit the terrain at a lower resolution (e.g., **1k Ã— 1k**) in the GUI, then use **Hesiod's batch mode** (headless, no GUI) to generate higher-resolution output. In batch mode, the actual limit depends on your hardwareâ€”primarily your **RAM and GPU memory**. As a rough estimate, resolutions up to **32k Ã— 32k** may be possible on powerful systems.
