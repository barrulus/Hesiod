# STATUS REPORT (2025-09-23)

This report summarises progress for the Hesiod Python migration, organised by phase and mapped directly to the tasks in `migration_plan.md` and the live burndown in `MIGRATION_ACTION.md`.

## Phase 0 - Discovery (Status: Complete)

| Task / Focus | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow inventory, dependency audit, MVP sign-off | Completed | Findings captured in `migration_plan.md`; no open discovery actions recorded in `MIGRATION_ACTION.md`. |

## Phase 1 - Architecture & Infrastructure (Status: Complete, with follow-ups)

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Scaffold Python package with core/nodes/io/ui/plugins/data | Completed | `hesiod_py/` tree in place with modules for core runtime, nodes, IO, UI, and data. |
| 2. Adopt build system and define tooling (uv, constraints, ruff, black, pyright) | In Progress | Tooling stack (Poetry, Ruff, Black, MyPy) configured via `pyproject.toml`; migration plan's preference for `uv` still outstanding. |
| 3. Configure CI for linting, tests, builds (Windows & Linux) | Completed | `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` runs lint, type check, and pytest on Ubuntu/Windows with Poetry. |
| 4. Specify configuration/serialization utilities | Completed | `hesiod_py/core/configuration.py` and `hesiod_py/core/logging.py` supply JSON-backed config, logging helpers. |
| 5. Draft architecture diagrams for runtime/UI/mosaic | Outstanding | Architecture docs exist (`docs/architecture/python_runtime.md`, `node_editor_options.md`), but no diagrams or visual models recorded yet. |

## Phase 2 - Core Runtime Port (Status: Complete)

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Implement graph model classes | Completed | `hesiod_py/core/graph.py`, `project.py` deliver graph/node/port/project models. |
| 2. Build scheduler with incremental recompute/memoisation | Completed | `GraphScheduler` + `ExecutionCache` in `hesiod_py/core/runtime.py`. |
| 3. Define heightmap/mesh abstractions | Completed | `hesiod_py/data/structures.py` defines `HeightMap` and `Mesh`. |
| 4. Port configuration management | Completed | Pydantic-based `AppConfiguration`, loader/saver utilities in `core/configuration.py`. |
| 5. Implement legacy `.hsd` importer | Completed (with limitations) | `hesiod_py/io/hsd.py` ingests legacy graphs; unsupported nodes reported. |
| 6. Establish automated runtime tests | Completed | Test suite (`tests/test_runtime.py`, etc.) covers graph execution, configuration, importer smoke tests. |

## Phase 3 - Node Library Migration (Status: Partially Complete)

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Implement core primitive nodes (noise/constants/transforms) | Completed | Modules under `hesiod_py/nodes/` plus unit tests. |
| 2. Port blend, filter, masking nodes | Completed | Blend/filter/mask implementations with coverage in tests. |
| 3. Recreate import/export nodes (heightmap/texture/normal map) | Completed | `image_io.py` handles import/export, normal map conversion. |
| 4. Migrate erosion/geological/quilting algorithms | Outstanding | No erosion/geology port yet; flagged as next major gap for parity. |
| 5. Build node metadata system | Completed | Registry metadata defined in `core/registry.py` and populated by node modules. |
| 6. Author unit/property tests, image diffs, benchmarks | In Progress | Unit tests exist for implemented nodes; property/image-diff suites and benchmarking strategy still pending. |
| Burndown: Finalise MVP node parity list | Outstanding | Tracked in `MIGRATION_ACTION.md`; awaiting stakeholder confirmation. |
| Burndown: Define benchmarking approach | Outstanding | No benchmarking harness yet. |

## Phase 4 - Python UI & Experience (Status: In Progress)

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Evaluate node-editor libraries and choose direction | Completed | Evaluation captured in `docs/architecture/node_editor_options.md`; NodeGraphQt selected. |
| 2. Implement graph canvas, node palette, property inspector, preview panes | Completed | NodeGraphQt shell now ships with palette/inspector/preview plus Midnight theme applied via `hesiod_py/ui/theme.py`. |
| 3. Integrate runtime execution with progress/preview | Completed | Status-bar progress, run-action disabling, and preview refresh now handled via `_execute_graph` and scheduler callbacks (`hesiod_py/ui/main_window.py`, `hesiod_py/core/runtime.py`). |
| 4. Recreate project management features (tabs, autosave, import/export dialogs) | Outstanding | No project/session management UI yet. |
| 5. Implement logging/notifications/diagnostics panels | In Progress | Log pane available; structured notifications & diagnostics backlog pending. |
| 6. Conduct usability testing with power users | Outstanding | No UX research sessions logged. |
| Packaging exit criteria (PyInstaller/Briefcase) | Outstanding | Packaging scripts/tests not started. |

## Phase 5 - Mosaic Builder & Release Prep (Status: Not Started)

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Implement mosaic builder services | Outstanding | No Python mosaic tooling yet. |
| 2. Provide CLI automation for mosaics | Outstanding | CLI requirements pending. |
| 3. Finalise documentation set | Outstanding | Major publication effort scheduled post Phases 3/4. |
| 4. Expand integration/stress testing & installers | Outstanding | Large-scale test matrix not begun. |
| 5. Performance tuning & optimisation | Outstanding | Profiling/optimisation plan not defined. |
| 6. Execute release governance checklist | Outstanding | Versioning, changelog, maintenance roadmap to be drafted nearer release. |

## Cross-Phase Governance & Risks

- Roadmap hygiene: `MIGRATION_ACTION.md` kept current; continue updating after each milestone.
- Risks (per action log): MVP node parity (High), performance targets (Medium), UI decision lag (Medium). First two remain open; third mitigated by adopting NodeGraphQt, but ongoing UX/theming work needed.
- Upcoming checkpoints: 2025-09-24 node parity review, 2025-10-01 benchmarking strategy review, 2025-10-08 UX alignment for UI workstream.

## Immediate Focus Recommendations

1. Close Phase 3 gaps by defining MVP node parity and beginning erosion/geology ports.
2. Extend Phase 4 UI towards project management workflows and progress feedback.
3. Establish benchmarking strategy to unblock remaining Phase 3 exit criteria.
4. Begin planning for Phase 5 governance items (CLI scope, release process) to avoid end-game compression.
